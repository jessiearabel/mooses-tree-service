The AI engineer successfully built a full-stack arborist exam study platform from scratch. The initial phase focused on a mock React frontend with features like multi-user authentication, a categorized question bank, timed exams, progress tracking, and bilingual support. After user approval, the backend was implemented using FastAPI and MongoDB, including user management, JWT authentication, and API endpoints for exams and questions.

Key challenges involved debugging the exam submission flow, specifically a CORS error, a backend Pydantic validation issue with  answers, and a frontend  dialog blocking the submission. The AI engineer systematically addressed these by examining logs, testing backend endpoints directly, and modifying frontend logic. Subsequently, the AI engineer integrated a custom moose logo and implemented a new Add Student feature, including its own backend API and frontend form. The current work revolves around building a dedicated super-administrator portal, including role management, a separate login, and basic admin dashboard components, with further implementation pending.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a web platform for studying the arborist exam for tree trimming services in the United States. The platform needs to support multiple-choice and true/false questions, timed exam simulations, and topics based on Louisiana's arborist exam schemes (ISA standards). It must be bilingual (Spanish/English) and support multiple students with user/password access, including progress tracking.

After initial development, the user requested:
1.  **Backend Integration**: Replace mock data with a MongoDB backend for persistent storage, real authentication (JWT), and APIs for questions, exams, and progress.
2.  **Logo Customization**: Replace the default Tree Pine logo with a provided moose image, including branding updates.
3.  **Student Management**: A link/feature to add new students, ensuring it's not on the main student profile.
4.  **Super-Administrator Portal**: A password-protected portal for super-administrators to add/remove questions and add/delete users, separate from student access.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development**: React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
-   **Authentication**: JWT for secure user sessions, bcrypt for password hashing.
-   **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configuration for frontend-backend communication.
-   **UI/UX**: Shadcn/UI components, Tailwind CSS for styling, responsive design.
-   **Data Validation**: Pydantic for API request/response models.
-   **Deployment**: Supervisor for service management, .env for environment variables.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.



-   : Main React component defining routing for Home, Login, Dashboard, AddStudent, and Admin routes. Modified to include new routes and branding.
-   : Manages user authentication state and JWT tokens. Initially used mock data, then updated for real backend JWT authentication.
-   : Handles user login. Updated to use real backend authentication and display the new logo.
-   : Displays user progress and navigation. Updated from mock data to real API calls and included the Add Student button (later removed for admin portal).
-   : Manages the exam flow. Heavily modified for backend integration, handling user answers, and debugging the submission process (CORS, Pydantic validation,  dialog).
-   : New component for student registration, integrated with backend  endpoint.
-   : New component to encapsulate the moose logo, allowing for flexible styling and replacement of previous icons.
-   : New component for the super-administrator login.
-   : New component for the super-administrator dashboard (currently empty).
-   : Main FastAPI application, includes routers and CORS middleware. Updated to include new admin router and environment variables.
-   : Defines Pydantic models for database entities (User, Question, Exam, StatusCheck, etc.). Updated to include user roles.
-   : Handles user authentication, password hashing, and JWT token creation/verification. Updated to incorporate user roles and admin password verification.
-   : Manages MongoDB connection.
-   : API endpoints for user login and registration.
-   : API endpoints for starting, submitting, and viewing exam history. Modified to handle  user answers during submission.
-   : API endpoints for fetching questions.
-   : New API endpoints for administrative tasks (currently planned for user and question management).
-   : Document outlining API contracts and backend implementation details.
-   : Stores mock data for frontend development (later removed).
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the implementation of the  component (for adding/deleting users in the admin portal).
-   Complete the implementation of the  component (for adding/removing questions in the admin portal).
-   Integrate a clear access point (link/route) for the admin portal into the application, ensuring it's discrete.

<current_work>
The current work is focused on implementing the super-administrator portal. The AI engineer has already:
1.  Removed the Add Student button from the regular student dashboard to centralize user management under admin control.
2.  Started implementing a role system in the backend, modifying  for user roles and  for role-based authentication logic. The  was also updated to include the necessary middleware.
3.  Created a dedicated backend router for admin functionalities at .
4.  Added the  () to the backend's  file and updated the server to utilize it.
5.  Created the frontend components  for administrator authentication and  to serve as the main admin interface. The system is designed such that administrative actions require re-authentication for security.
The immediate last action was to confirm the admin password to the user.
